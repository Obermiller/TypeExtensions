<h1>Obermiller.TypeExtensions</h1>

<p>This is a collection of extensions which I've found useful over the course of my career.</p>

<p>I've bundled them up into this NuGet package hoping it can help someone else on their coding journey.</p>

<p>Many of these methods are static methods to extend common types within C#.<p>

<p>Currently, it has no prerequisites aside from being utilized with .Net 6 or .Net 7.</p>

<p>At the moment, this package includes methods for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Enumerables</li>
    <li>Strings</li>
</ul>
