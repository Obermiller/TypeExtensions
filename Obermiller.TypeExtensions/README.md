# Obermiller.TypeExtensions

This is a collection of extensions which I've found useful over the course of my career.

I've bundled them up into this NuGet package hoping it can help someone else on their coding journey.

Many of these methods are static methods to extend common types within C#.

Currently, it has no prerequisites aside from being utilized with .Net 6 - 8.

At the moment, this package includes methods for:

- Booleans
- Classes
- DateTimes
- Enumerables
- Strings
